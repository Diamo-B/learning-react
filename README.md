<strong>React</strong> (also known as <strong>React.js</strong> or <strong>ReactJS</strong>) is a free and open-source front-end <strong>JavaScript</strong> library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. <strong>React</strong> can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, <strong>React</strong> is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.
